* Native work with threads and requests
* Built-in long arithmetic
* Convenient and easy to understand syntax
* Interactive mode, similar in implementation to Python
* Ð¡onvenient package manager
* Developed in parallel IDE specifically for this language and having native support for all its features, advanced code analysis and syntax highlighting

## Language key features: 

* Lambda functions
* Functions with dynamic return value determination
* Implicit (automatic) type conversions are forbidden in the language, but allowed between numerical types to simplify calculations
* Input / output using the console and file system
* Well-developed object-oriented paradigm with the possibility of multiple inheritance, creating properties, overloaded constructors, methods, fields and various access modifiers
