# Neko-Interpreter

Neko is a scripting programming language inspired by Kotlin and Python, which is being developed for writing fast and powerful code in a short amount of time. It includes following techniques:

* Object-oriented and functional paradigms
* Division into dynamic and static variables
* Strong typing
* Powerful built-in library
* Native work with threads and requests
* Built-in long arithmetic
* Convenient and easy to understand syntax
* Interactive mode, similar in implementation to Python
* Ð¡onvenient package manager
* Developed in parallel IDE specifically for this language and having native support for all its features, advanced code analysis and syntax highlighting

## Language key features: 

* Lambda functions
* Division into low-level C++ types like int16, string, bool, etc and high-level types based on Object type. For example Int, Bool, Float, String
* Functions with dynamic return value determination
* Implicit (automatic) type conversions are forbidden in the language, but allowed between numerical types to simplify calculations
* Input / output using the console and file system
* Well-developed object-oriented paradigm with the possibility of multiple inheritance, creating properties, overloaded constructors, methods, fields and various access modifiers
* The possibility of calculations in complex arithmetic
* Many standard functions and data structures based on C ++ implementation (ArrayList implements std::vector, Set implements std::set, Map implements std::map, etc)
* Support of syntax features implemented in Kotlin, Python, Go and C++, like ability to use elif instead of else if or various initialization methods, allowing the syntax of Kotlin (using var / val), Go (with :=), and Python (without anything)
